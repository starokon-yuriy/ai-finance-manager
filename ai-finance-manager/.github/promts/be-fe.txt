lets integrate BE and FE together,  We need to ensure that the APIs are well-defined and that the data flow between the front-end
and back-end is efficient.

analyse UI code and BE code to identify the necessary API endpoints and data structures required for the integration.

To integrate the back-end (BE) and front-end (FE) together, we need to follow these steps:
for the select Category dropdown in UI, call the API @GetMapping("/categories")

for the Add Income and Add Expense, call the API @PostMapping("/transactions") with the appropriate payload to create a new transaction.

for the Balance tab in UI, call the API @GetMapping("/transactions") to fetch the current balance and display it to the user.
the api should apply dates from date picker in UI, so the user can filter transactions by date range.
and GET /transactions should be called 2 times for INCOMES and EXPENSES balances, with a parameter to specify the type of transactions (income or expense).

the Dowload CSV button in UI should call the API @GetMapping("/transactions/export") to download the transactions in CSV format.
